My personal favorite project was the result of a 4-day Hackathon. It was called Clique-On, a realtime live geolocation sharing all hosted on a TDD and continuous integration through Travis CI and deployed on heroku to demo.
 
The newest innovation incorporating Google Maps API, Pubnub, React, Redux to bring you a multiplatform geolocation tracking tool for anyone to use and privately for their friends!
 
This utilized my entire skill set as a full stack developer by incorporating persistent user data, design, and room management. Being behind the development process of understanding the user flow as well as implementing it first hand was the most gratifying process.
